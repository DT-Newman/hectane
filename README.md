The goal of Hectane is simple: to create an SMTP client that is extremely easy to configure and use. The application exposes a simple HTTP API that is used for sending emails.

Hectane can be run as a standalone application or embedded in a Go application.

### Features

- ability to attach files to emails
- support for TLS encryption and HTTP basic auth
- mail queue that efficiently delivers emails to hosts
- emails in the queue are stored on disk until delivery
- MX records for the destination host are tried in order of priority
- run the application as a service on Windows

### Usage

To launch the application, simply run the executable:

    ./hectane

The application recognizes the following command-line parameters (all are optional):

- `-config` - JSON file containing configuration
- `-bind` - address to bind to (in the format `host:port` - default is `:8025`)
- `-tls-cert` - path to TLS certificate
- `-tls-key` - path to TLS key
- `-username` - username for HTTP basic auth
- `-password` - password for HTTP basic auth
- `-directory` - storage location for emails awaiting delivery
- `-disable-ssl-verification` - disables verification of server SSL certificates
- `-logfile` - file to write log output to
- `-debug` - show debug log messages

### API

Hectane exposes an HTTP API that can be used to deliver emails. The API expects and responds with JSON data. Currently, the API consists of the following methods:

#### POST /v1/raw

##### Parameters

- `from` - sender email address
- `to` - list of recipient email addresses
- `body` - UTF-8 encoded message body

##### Response

The response is either an empty JSON object (indicating success) or a JSON object with an `error` key describing the problem.

#### POST /v1/send

##### Parameters

- `from` - sender email address
- `to` - list of recipient email addresses
- `cc` - list of carbon copy recipients
- `bcc` - list of blind carbon copy recipients
- `subject` - email subject
- `headers` - a map of additional headers to include
- `text` - body of the email as plain text
- `html` - body of the email as HTML
- `attachments` - a list of attachments:
    - `filename` - filename of the attachment
    - `content_type` - MIME type of the attachment (for example, `text/plain`)
    - `content` - UTF-8 or base64 encoded content of the attachment
    - `encoded` - `true` if `content` is base64 encoded

##### Response

The response is either an empty JSON object (indicating success) or a JSON object with an `error` key describing the problem.

#### GET /v1/status
